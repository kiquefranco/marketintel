# Prioritization — Adjustments & Features

Every prioritization change made to the Market Intelligence briefing, with what it does and
where it lives. Most scoring behavior is in `config/settings.yaml → briefing.relevance_guidance`
(no code change needed to tune); selection mechanics are in `run_briefing.py` + `config/`.

## 2026-09-08 — prioritization comparison email

A third email, to the two people who tune the scoring (Kique, Pranav), answering one question:
where did the strategy pass and the ambulatory pass disagree today? It is a diagnostic, not a
briefing — no story content, because the two briefings already carry it.

- **NEW — `src/output/comparison.py`.** Divergence-first layout: three buckets (strategy only /
  ambulatory only / sent by both), each line carrying BOTH lenses' scores and the rationale of
  the side that passed on the story, then a titles-only second-tier column per side. Scores show
  ONE decimal (unlike the reader-facing badge, which truncates) because the near-miss is the
  point. `--` means that side never scored the article; it never renders as 0.0.
- **Scope is what was SENT** — tier-1 cards plus the "Also worth noting" tier — not a top-N of
  the candidate pool.
- **Fires on every run**, including quiet days: one side going silent while the other ships is
  itself the finding, and a missing email is indistinguishable from a broken pipeline.
- **Wiring.** `prioritize_for_profile` returns a 4th value (`pool`, every candidate that pass
  scored) and keeps `house_composite` on each copy; `_send_semantic_profiles` returns per-group
  records instead of a bool; `_run_comparison` runs after both sends in the normal AND quiet-day
  paths, wrapped fail-safe, consuming no dedup state and skipped under `--recipients`.
- **Config — `briefing.comparison`** in settings.yaml: `enabled`, `profile`
  (`Ambulatory-Rafic`), labels, `subject_prefix`, `recipients`. A third recipient list on top of
  `digest_recipients` and the profiles.
- **Test — `scripts/test_comparison.py`**, offline, no DB/LLM/network.

## 2026-09-08 — no invented addresses

Triggered by the 2026-09-05 briefing: a title-only Florida YIMBY item on construction starting
at "The Triangle" in Miami's Health District was written up with the street address
1400 NW 10th Ave. That address is in no source the pipeline held — the item's summary field is
its own title repeated, and browsing is off, so the model supplied a plausible Health District
address from prior knowledge.

- **NEW — rule 10 in `briefing.synthesis_style`.** Street addresses, cross-streets, block
  numbers, parcel locations, distances and adjacency claims are reproduced ONLY when the exact
  string appears in the item's title, summary, key facts, full text, or research context.
  Otherwise state the location at the level the source gives it, or "address not disclosed."
  Prior knowledge, earlier briefings on the same project, and related articles are not sources.
  A title-only item supports no address at all. Carries the real failure as a worked example.
- **NEW — same rule hard-coded in `src/output/synthesize.py`'s `what_happened` spec**, so it
  holds on any path that runs with an empty style guide.
- Covers all three synthesis call sites (house pass, profile pass, token-overrun retry) — each
  passes `synthesis_style` through.

## 0. 2026-07-15 calibration (strategy-team review of the 7/15 run)

Driven by feedback on `feedback_2026-07-15.xlsx`. All in `briefing.relevance_guidance`.

- **NEW — HCA corporate news is competitor news.** HCA Healthcare operates HCA Florida in
  UHealth's region, so HCA corporate-level news (earnings, forecasts, coverage-mix pressure,
  system strategy) is classified and scored as SOUTH FLORIDA COMPETITIVE intel with the
  competitor lens, not generic national policy. (HCA 2026 earnings-forecast cut → 7, right
  score, wrong area.)
- **NEW — early pilots/trials cap at ~6.** Tech/device/wearable being tested at a handful of
  clinics — especially out-of-region — is not hospital adoption; no geography + no at-scale
  adoption = max 6. High still requires peer-system deployment or regulatory clearance.
  (Whoop joint-replacement trial at 3 California clinics → 6, was 7.)
- **NEW — two trend-topic exceptions score a strong 6** (override "general trends are low" for
  these only): hospital **M&A market/trend reports** (M&A is a strategy the team actively
  explores — good slow-day material; Q2 M&A report → 6, was 5) and **market-level digital-health
  funding roundups** ($7.4B funding report → 6, was 5; a single startup's round stays 3-4).
- **Reinforced low/exclude:** patient-experience awareness pieces ("patients stuck in red
  tape" → 2-3, was 5 — do not surface); generic big-tech healthcare-AI initiatives with nothing
  adoptable (Google healthcare-AI evidence base → 3-4, was 5).
- **Confirmed correct:** single physician hires at competitors → 6 (Baptist Miami Neuroscience,
  Holy Cross — "key hiring sure, but physician hiring so 6 is on point"); insurers suing CMS
  over MA stars → 5; payer-denials how-to → 6 contingent on actionability (precedent > advice).

## 0. 2026-07-13 calibration (strategy-team review of the 7/13 run)

Driven by feedback on `feedback_2026-07-13.xlsx`. All in `briefing.relevance_guidance`.

- **NEW — 35-mile PPS-exempt band (the key change).** Competitor moves WITHIN the ~35-mile
  PPS-exempt band around UHealth's Miami campus matter more than moves outside it. Roughly:
  Miami-Dade + most of Broward inside; Palm Beach County (West Palm Beach, Jupiter, Boca Raton)
  and beyond outside. Outside-band moves are still prioritized (scored a notch lower) and the
  rationale must flag "outside the 35-mile PPS-exempt band" so the note carries into the
  briefing. (Ex: HCA Palms West freestanding ER in West Palm Beach → 9 with the note.)
- **Single physician hires at competitors → ~6.** Too narrow, no clear UHealth implication;
  below institutional moves. (Marcus Neuroscience neurologist hire → 6.)
- **Payer-denial/downcoding pieces: precedent > advice.** 7-8 only if a NAMED health system
  actually did it; generic how-to stays 6.
- **Non-competitor Florida hospitals' vendor adoptions → ~5.** (Florida Coast + OrthoGrid → 5;
  6 was generous.)
- **Reinforced low/exclude:** cybersecurity/ransomware trend pieces (→ 3, not a strategy-team
  function); out-of-state insurance/policy mechanics that don't transfer across state lines
  (Indiana insurance switch → 2); out-of-region systems UHealth neither competes with nor relies
  on — incl. the Memorial Hermann (Houston) "Memorial" name collision (→ 2-3).
- **Confirmed correct:** integrated pharmacy at 8, ACO REACH savings at 7, adoptable AI
  note-taking at 7.

## 0. 2026-06-29 calibration (strategy-team review of the 6/29 run)

Driven by feedback on `feedback_2026-06-29.xlsx`. All in `briefing.relevance_guidance`.

- **NEW — never surface partisan politics.** Stories hooked on partisan politics or a named
  political figure (a court blocking a President's plan, elections, partisan fights) score 1-2
  and are excluded. Carve-out: concrete funding/reimbursement/regulatory CHANGES that hit UHealth
  (NIH, Medicare/Medicaid, 340B, GME) are still scored on substance — the rule targets political
  framing, not policy. (Ex: "Judge blocks Trump grad-loan plan" → 2.)
- **Funding rounds lowered 3-4 (was ~6).** A raise alone is not actionable; the trigger is a
  product launch or a hospital partnership. (Assort Health $120M → 3-4; both Cadence examples
  realigned 6/5 → 4.)
- **Flagship-competitor clinical advances bumped to 6-7.** A pure clinical/science finding is
  normally ~2, but a TOP in-region competitor advancing in a UHealth flagship line — especially
  oncology, the most profitable line — is competitive intel. (Cleveland Clinic glioblastoma → 6-7.)
- **Foreign disease outbreaks → 5 (slow-day only).** No US/Florida/UHealth impact = not a
  typical-day inclusion, distinct from a genuine global pandemic. (Ebola/DRC → 5.)
- **Reinforced low/exclude:** patient-care human-interest UHealth can't act on (gun-victim
  discharge → 2-3), drug-pricing/Medicare-prescription (→ 2-3), ESG/AI commentary (→ 3), and
  generic AI thought-leadership (→ 2-3).

## Competitor location verification (2026-06-29)

- **NEW — verify location on name collisions.** An Alabama "Jackson Hospital" was scored as Miami's
  Jackson Health System on the name alone. Added a rule to `relevance_guidance`: before scoring any
  story as a competitor, confirm it's the SOUTH FLORIDA institution (Miami-Dade/Broward/Palm Beach
  via dateline/city/address). Same-name out-of-region institutions = noise (1-2); unconfirmed
  location = score low (2-3). Sole exception: the source is the competitor's own website (Yutori
  scout on their newsroom). Names that collide: Jackson (AL), Baptist Health (KY/TN/AL/TX), Mount
  Sinai (NY), Memorial (many states).

## Briefing format (2026-06-29)

- `src/output/emailer.py` (`render_html`): removed the **Key Question Answers** section; added a
  **relevance-score badge** ("Relevance N/10") next to each story title. Top-Line Takeaways kept.
- `run_briefing.py`: attaches each story's LLM relevance score (matched from ranked DB rows by
  URL then title) so the renderer can display it.

## 0. 2026-06-25 calibration (strategy-team review of the 6/25 run)

Driven by feedback on the top-50 feedback workbook (`feedback_2026-06-25.xlsx`).

- **Audience reframed: STRATEGY team, not general C-suite.** `relevance_guidance` now states the
  bar explicitly — "good to know for leadership" is NOT enough; if a strategy team can't act on,
  plan around, or track it for a likely response, cap at ~6. Strengthened GATE 2 accordingly.
- **Funding rounds are not actionable (cap ~6).** A raise becomes high only when the product
  ships or a hospital partners with the company (e.g. Cadence $100M raise → 6).
- **Selection bar lowered: `select_threshold` 90 → 80** (`config/settings.yaml`). The reviewer
  repeatedly flagged 8/10 stories (OpenEvidence FDA AI, CDC-nominee/United, Mount Sinai AI,
  Optum, 340B) as ones that should appear. With the rubric now pushing non-actionable items to
  ≤6 and `max_stories` capped at 12, an 8/10 bar yields a clean 8–10 strategy report.
- **Dedup tightened: `dedup_cosine_similarity` 0.85 → 0.82** (`config/weights.yaml`) — two
  near-identical STAT stories on the same OpenEvidence tool both surfaced.
- **New worked-example block (2026-06-25)** added to `relevance_guidance` capturing: individual
  crime → 0–1 (fake nursing diplomas); patient-ops AI awareness → 6 (Medicare AI delays); AI
  opinion → 4 (Epic/Faulkner); out-of-state policy → 6 (Indiana price caps); competitor
  AI-governance intel → 8 (Mount Sinai), with an out-of-region discount → 7.5 (Duke/Texas);
  in-region community investment bumped 7 → 8 (Cleveland Clinic FL); near-but-not-SF competitor
  → 6 (Florida Coast); industry context → 7/also-considered (US health spending $5.7T).

## 1. Scoring frame & audience

1. **Exec-facing strategic lens.** Score each story by its **impact on UHealth's strategy and
   long-term direction**, fusing external competitive intelligence with operational/financial/
   strategic impact. A story can score high purely on strategic impact with no competitor in it.
   _(relevance_guidance)_
2. **Grounded UHealth profile.** The org description now reflects UHealth's real profile from
   umiamihealth.org — academic medical center; ~1.7M visits, 700 beds, 40 locations, 14,628 staff;
   active expansion (SoLé Mia, Doral, Pinecrest, Griffin building, Tower, Bascom Palmer Abu Dhabi);
   ~$178.8M NIH; AI priority; UnitedHealthcare negotiation; Jackson/HSS/VA/Siemens/Labcorp.
   _(org.description + relevance_guidance)_
3. **Pure LLM relevance, full 0–10 range, strict.** Composite = 100% LLM relevance (area/source
   weights off). Most general policy/industry-trend items belong at 3–5, not 7–9. _(weights.yaml)_

## 2. The scoring gates

4. **Gate 1 — direct UHealth relevance.** UHealth is a provider/academic system, not a pharma,
   PBM, or insurer. Third-party lawsuits/disputes score 2–3 unless they hit UHealth directly.
5. **Gate 2 — actionability.** "State of the market" / "what it means for patients" / awareness /
   routine-regulatory-color pieces cap at 3–5. Opinion pieces = 1.
6. **Gate 3 — judge against UHealth's existing position.** Relevance = a real gap/threat/
   opportunity given what UHealth already is — not a keyword match. Topics where UHealth is
   already strong (e.g. talent pipeline via the Miller School) are not priorities just for matching.

## 3. What scores high (strategic vectors, 8–10)

7. **Growth / competitive footprint** — competitor capital/capacity/M&A/partnership/service-line
   moves in South Florida, weighted to UHealth's expansion zones (North Miami/Aventura, Doral,
   Pinecrest, west Miami-Dade).
8. **Federal/state funding & policy** — NIH/research-grant funding, Medicare/Medicaid
   reimbursement, 340B, graduate medical education, academic-medical-center policy.
9. **Payer / reimbursement leverage** — a major payer's network/reimbursement/denial moves
   affecting UHealth's own contracts (cf. the UnitedHealthcare negotiation). Not pharma/PBM.
10. **Flagship service lines (as a lens for EXTERNAL developments)** — ophthalmology (Bascom
    Palmer), oncology (Sylvester), neuro/neurosurgery, urology (Desai Sethi), transplant, cardiac,
    rehab (Miami Project).
11. **Workforce / talent** — nurse/physician labor markets, unionization, competitor recruitment
    (scored on a real gap/threat, not generic trend pieces).
12. **AI / health-tech (gated — see #16).**
13. **Partnership ecosystem** — moves by/affecting Jackson Health, HSS, the VA, Siemens, Labcorp.

## 4. Exclusions & de-prioritizations

14. **Pharmacy / drug-pricing / PBM is NOT a priority** (reversed mid-project). Scored only on
    direct UHealth impact; a PBM lawsuit or drug-pricing rule is general (3–5) or, if it's another
    company's fight, low (2–3). Don't boost an item just because it involves drugs/pharmacy/PBMs.
15. **Exclude UHealth's own news.** The audience already knows their own announcements. Anything
    about UHealth's own institutes/people (Sylvester, Bascom Palmer, Desai Sethi, Miami Transplant,
    Miller School, Miami Project, UHealth Tower) scores 1–2. Sole exception: an external reputation
    risk leadership must respond to.
16. **AI relevance gate.** AI scores high only if UHealth could actually adopt it OR a peer health
    system is concretely deploying it. Biotech/pharma AI, vendors UHealth doesn't use, and generic
    "AI is transforming healthcare" commentary score 2–4. The test is "could UHealth act on this?",
    not "does it mention AI?"
17. **Human-interest floor.** Patient-facing human-interest / cancer-survivorship / wellness
    pieces and routine local public-health warnings (e.g. a state opioid advisory) score 1–3.
18. **Geography is a competitive-footprint lens, not a universal gate.** National peer-system
    operational/AI practices count even when out-of-region.
19. **Cybersecurity & research = "keep an eye on" awareness.** Healthcare data breaches (UHealth
    holds lots of patient data) and research funding/policy color sit in the middle tier (5–6) —
    good for exec awareness on a slow day, never high on their own.

## 5. Deterministic rules (code-enforced, regardless of content)

20. **FIU + Baptist same-sentence → auto-floor 9.** Any article with both "FIU" (or "Florida
    International University") and "Baptist" in a single sentence is floored at 9 — because Baptist
    is moving into academic medicine via FIU's medical school, a direct threat to UHealth's
    academic-medical positioning. A floor, not a cap (never lowers a higher score). Config-driven
    and extensible. _(settings.yaml → briefing.forced_floor_rules; scoring.forced_floor)_

## 6. Output selection & email

21. **Selection: include all ≥ 90, min 5, max 12.** Replaced the fixed top-5. Strong days surface
    more (up to 12); quiet days still show a baseline of 5. _(settings.yaml: select_threshold 90 /
    min_stories 5 / max_stories 12; run_briefing.prioritize)_
22. **Re-brief window = 24h** (kept as-is by decision) so stories don't repeat day-to-day.
23. **LLM relevance score badge** shown next to each headline in the email. _(emailer)_
24. **"Also considered" runners-up list** — the next 5 stories below the cut, as title + link +
    score, for comparison. _(emailer + run_briefing)_

## 7. Sources & data hygiene

25. **Removed NOAA weather bulletins** from the source list (noise, undateable). _(sources.yaml)_
26. **Purged stale undated Fierce rows** that were lingering from a pre-switch native-feed pull.
    _(scripts/purge_stale_undated.py)_

## 8. Calibration (worked examples baked into the prompt)

27. **Worked examples from your own judgments** anchor the scale — drawn from your original review
    spreadsheet, the daily-review notes (2026-06-17), plus strategic/flagship illustrative cases
    (e.g. Yale peer-AI → 8, biotech-AI → 3, Abridge vendor → 3, talent-pipeline → 5, cancer-
    survivorship → 2, opioid warning → 3, IRhythm breach → 6). _(relevance_guidance)_

## 9. Tooling to review & tune prioritization

28. **Daily review spreadsheet** of scored articles with score, rationale, feedback columns, and
    tiered color coding.
29. **"Today's new articles" workbook** — today's extractions + significance, excluding anything
    already shown in a prior briefing, with a notes/feedback column and color key.
30. **`scripts/test_synthesis.py`** — run a hand-written article through the real scorer + the
    forced-floor + Gemini synthesis + email rendering, to test scoring and formatting in isolation.
31. **`scripts/score_report.py`** + `--dry-run` — inspect how everything ranks without sending.
