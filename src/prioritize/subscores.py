"""Structured sub-score capture.

A second, cheap LLM pass that breaks each candidate article into the universal
strategic dimensions (each 0-10) listed in DIMENSIONS below. These are:
  - stored as JSON on the article (column `subscores`), stamped with
    SUBSCORE_VERSION so a vector from an older dimension list / prompt is never
    silently reused, and
  - the raw material for AHP analysis (scripts/ahp.py) and per-executive
    personalization (src/profiles.py).

This module is ADDITIVE: it does not modify store.py or llm_relevance.py.
It ensures its own DB column exists and writes to it directly.
