# Healthcare Market Intelligence Platform

AI-driven daily executive briefing covering six intelligence areas: National Healthcare
Policy & Industry, South Florida Competitive Intel, Payer & Insurance, Innovation & AI,
Public Health & Geopolitical Risk, and Reputation & Media Monitoring.

**Pipeline:** RSS + Yutori-scout ingestion → SQLite store → 3-day publish-date filter →
LLM relevance scoring (vs. UHealth) → semantic dedup → 24h re-brief suppression →
LLM synthesis → HTML digest email. A separate watchdog alerts if a day's run is missed.

## How it works & why (build notes)

Step-by-step of what the pipeline does each run, and the reasoning behind each choice.

1. **Ingest (`src/ingest/`).** Free RSS/Google-News feeds cover most sources. The seven
   competitor health systems we monitor (Baptist Health, Jackson Health, Cleveland Clinic
   Florida, Memorial Healthcare, Mount Sinai, HCA Florida, Broward Health) expose no usable
   RSS — checked 2026-06-12, Broward 2026-08-10 — so they're monitored by **Yutori
   "scouts"**, agents that read the newsroom pages and return structured findings.
   Everything lands in one SQLite file (`data/intel.db`), deduped on exact URL at write time.

2. **3-day window by *publish* date (`run_briefing._is_recent`).** We keep only stories
   published in the last 72h — so a Monday run covers the weekend back to Friday. We filter on
   the article's *publish* date, not when we fetched it, so an old story a scout surfaces today
   can't sneak in. Items that arrive **undated** are first date-enriched (`src/ingest/enrich.py`):
   we fetch the article page and read the publish date the site records, so the window filters
   on a true date. Only if that also fails do we fall back to fetch time — a rare exception, so
   nothing provably older than 72h gets through, while genuinely-recent undated stories are kept.

3. **Relevance scoring (`src/prioritize/`).** Every recent article is scored 0–10 by the LLM
   (Gemini) for relevance to UHealth, judged against its intelligence area's key question.
   We deliberately use **pure LLM relevance** (composite weights in `weights.yaml`): keyword
   rules were removed because they were blunt — they surfaced local fluff and missed strong
   stories with unexpected wording. Scoring runs at **temperature 0** so the same article gets
   the same score every run (consistent rankings). The prompt also weights **actionability** —
   items implying a concrete decision/response (e.g. a competitor building a hospital) score
   above passive, informational ones (e.g. a routine weather outlook); rubric is tunable in
   `settings.yaml: briefing.relevance_guidance`. A **per-source cap** (`max_per_source`)
   stops a high-volume feed from flooding the pool; competitor sources are exempt
   (`uncapped_sources`) so their coverage is never trimmed.

4. **Semantic dedup (`scoring.semantic_dedupe_track`).** The same event often arrives from several
   feeds with different wording. We embed each story (Gemini embeddings) and merge ones whose
   *meaning* is near-identical (cosine ≥ `dedup_cosine_similarity`) — keeping the higher-scored
   copy. This generalizes far better than matching words. The keyword rules then run as a
   UNION over the survivors (2026-09-01), so a pair the cosine threshold missed is still caught.

   *Across days (`store.candidates_recent` / `mark_briefed`):* once a story is briefed it's
   stamped with the time it *first* went out and stays eligible for `rebrief_after_hours`
   (default 24h), then is suppressed. So re-running the same day reproduces the same briefing
   instead of burning a fresh top-5 each run, while the next day's run rolls over to new
   stories. This depends on the SQLite dedup memory persisting between runs (see Scheduling).

5. **Synthesis (`src/output/synthesize.py`).** The top stories go to the LLM, which writes the
   per-story narrative (what happened / why it matters to UHealth / exposure / what to watch).
   It's told to produce one story per item (dedup already happened upstream).

6. **Digest email (`src/output/emailer.py`).** Top N stories rendered as HTML with an
   intelligence-area tag + source up top and a larger headline. Publish dates come from Yutori
   first, else from reading the article page's metadata, else shown as "—". If *nothing* clears
   the threshold, a short **quiet-day note** is sent anyway, so silence never looks like a
   broken pipeline.

7. **Scheduling.** Scouts scan once daily at 5am ET (set at scout creation). The briefing runs
   ~6:07am ET weekdays via GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/daily-briefing.yml`; cron `7 10`,
   deliberately off the top of the hour, which GitHub's scheduler delays/drops most often), so
   the fresh scan precedes the email. A **watchdog** (`.github/workflows/briefing-watchdog.yml`,
   ~8:12am ET) checks the GitHub API for a successful briefing run that day and emails an
   `[ALERT]` if none is found — so a silently dropped schedule never goes unnoticed. Secrets
   live in GitHub (never in the repo); dedup memory is durable — `data/intel.db` is committed
   back to the repo after each successful run (shared by local + CI runs, and the daily commit
   also keeps the schedule from auto-pausing).

**Cost.** RSS/Google-News is free. Gemini ≈ a few cents/run (scoring, synthesis, embeddings,
and the Background web-search step), well inside the free grounding allowance of 1,500
grounded queries/day.

Yutori is the only material spend. Three APIs are in use, at published rates:

| API | Rate | What triggers it |
|---|---|---|
| Scouting | $0.35 per scout-run | One run per source per day, on Yutori's schedule |
| Browsing | $0.015 per step (`navigator-n1.5-latest`) | Every briefed story (`browse_all`), max 12 steps |
| Research | $0.35 per task | Stories with `llm_score >= research_min_relevance`, max 5/run |

**Monthly budget: $100.** Scoped to **seven competitor scouts** — Baptist Health, Jackson
Health, Cleveland Clinic Florida, Memorial Healthcare, Mount Sinai Medical Center, HCA
Florida, and Broward Health. Central estimate ≈ $92/month:

| Component | Monthly | Basis |
|---|---|---|
| Scouting | $74.48 | 7 sources × 30.4 daily runs × $0.35 |
| Browsing | $9.40 | ~5.7 briefed stories/day × 22 weekdays × ~5 steps |
| Research | $8.21 | ~1.1 tasks/day × 22 weekdays (threshold 9) |

Two things to know when re-forecasting. **Scouts bill on ~30.4 days, not 22** — they run on
their own daily interval regardless of whether the weekday briefing fires. And **browsing +
research (≈$18) do not scale with source count**, because they are driven by how many stories
are *briefed*, which selection caps at 5–12/day no matter how many sources feed in. So the
variable cost is ≈$10.64 per monitored source per month, on a ≈$18 fixed base — scouting is
~80% of the bill.

`research_min_relevance` was raised 8 → 9 on 2026-08-10 to hold this budget: at threshold 8
research ran ≈$22.59/mo and the total ≈$106. Remaining levers if it needs to come down
further: drop a scout to weekly ($1.52/mo vs $10.64), or lower `browsing_max_steps` (minor).

Upside case, using the *observed* maxima rather than the config caps (9 stories briefed in a
day, 4 of them scoring ≥9): ≈$120/month, and only if every single day ran at that maximum,
which has not happened. The config ceilings (`max_browse` 12, `max_research` 5) are not
reachable in practice — the per-source cap and the 5–12 selection band mean a single source
never contributes 12 stories.

## Work Plan

Status date: **June 16, 2026**. Owners: **W** = William, **F** = Fernando, **C** = Christoph.
Full background in `docs/Implementation_Plan.docx`.

**Current status:** live and automated end-to-end — Gemini scoring/synthesis (billing
enabled), real sends validated, scheduled 6:07am ET weekday run (scouts scan 5am) +
missed-run watchdog in place. Scouts live: **Baptist, Jackson**. Target scope is **seven
competitor scouts** at a **$100/month Yutori budget** — Cleveland Clinic Florida, Memorial
Healthcare, Mount Sinai, HCA Florida, and Broward Health remain to be activated (all five
are already declared `type: yutori` in `config/sources.yaml`; create with
`scripts/setup_scouts.py`).
Remaining work is calibration, scaling competitor scouts, and leadership go-live sign-off.

## Setup (5 minutes)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kiquefranco/marketintel.git && cd marketintel
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env    # then fill in your keys (see below)
```

Required keys in `.env`:

| Variable | Where to get it |
|---|---|
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | aistudio.google.com (billing enabled — default provider) |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | console.anthropic.com (only if `llm.provider: anthropic`) |
| `YUTORI_API_KEY` | platform.yutori.com (scouts live; `--no-yutori` to skip) |
| `SMTP_USER` / `SMTP_PASS` | Gmail address + App Password (Google Account → Security → 2-Step Verification → App passwords) |
| `EMAIL_FROM` | sender address shown on the digest |
| `ALERT_EMAIL_TO` | watchdog alert recipient (falls back to `SMTP_USER`) |

Digest **recipients** are set in `config/settings.yaml` (`briefing.digest_recipients`), not
in `.env` — currently `wef28@miami.edu`.

## Running

```bash
python scripts/verify_sources.py                       # check all RSS feed URLs
python run_briefing.py --dry-run --no-yutori --no-llm  # free ingestion test
python run_briefing.py --dry-run --no-yutori           # full dry run -> data/briefings/
python scripts/score_report.py                         # why each story ranked where it did
python run_briefing.py                                 # real run (sends email)
```

## Scheduling the daily run

**Option A — GitHub Actions (recommended, in use):** `.github/workflows/daily-briefing.yml`
runs ~6:07am ET every weekday in the cloud (cron `7 10`). Add the `.env` values as repository
secrets (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions), plus `ALERT_EMAIL_TO` for the watchdog.
No computer needs to be on. The `briefing-watchdog.yml` workflow emails an alert if a day's run
is missed.

**Option B — local cron (macOS/Linux):**
```
7 10 * * 1-5 cd /path/to/marketintel && .venv/bin/python run_briefing.py
```

## Tuning

All scoring behavior lives in `config/weights.yaml` (category/source weights, composite mix,
threshold) and `config/settings.yaml` (org profile, key questions, LLM provider/models,
lookback window, `rebrief_after_hours`, digest recipients). No code changes needed to retune.

## Working on this repo with Claude Code

`CLAUDE.md` gives Claude Code full project context. Open a terminal in the repo, run
`claude`, and ask for a task, e.g. "implement the Yutori Scouting API in src/ingest/yutori.py".

## Team workflow

`git pull` before you start · commit small, push often · never commit `.env` or API keys ·
weights changes get a one-line rationale in the commit message.
